# CodeClauseInternship_Movie-Genre-Prediction

#Overview

This project focuses on predicting the genre of a movie based on its summary plot. 
Using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with TF-IDF vectorization, the model is trained on a dataset of movie plot summaries. 
The cleaned and preprocessed text is used to build a classification model that can predict genres for unseen movie plots.

Import libraries, load the training dataset, clean the text, remove stopwords, and train the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier with TF-IDF vectorization.

Load the trained model and predict genres for the test dataset, saving the results as a CSV file.
